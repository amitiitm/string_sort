# Beezwax Recruiting Exercise Dev Environment
This repo presents a base Rails 5 install for the standard Beezwax recruiting exercise so that you can spend your time writing code and not configuring an environment.

Clone like so:

    git clone git@github.com:beezwax/recruiting-exercise.git beezwax-exercise && cd beezwax-exercise && bundle install

Both MiniTest and Rspec are available, and it includes haml. Feel free to use any library you want.

## Do not create a public repo
We'd prefer not to have solutions to the exercise around in the wild. Please do *not* create a public repo.

## Submit the exercise using Email
Once you're done, please zip up your solution and return it to us, simply email it at careers@beezwax.net. We'll send it around the team for review, and you should hear back from us in one or two business days. While not always possible, we endeavor to give meaningful feedback on every submission.

### Using Gmail
Gmail now blocks attachments with javascript files (as well as compressed archives that include js files).

Since we ask you not to put your solution in a public repository, the best way to return it would be to make the archive available via Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar, and send us the link.
